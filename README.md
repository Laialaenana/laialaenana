## Hi, I'm Laia! ðŸ‘¾

ðŸŽ¨ Iâ€™m a graphic designer turned full-stack web developer based in Spain. After finishing my degree in Graphic Design, I completed an intensive Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, where I specialized in creating responsive, user-focused websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MySQL.

âœ¨ My passion is at the intersection of design and technology: I love building websites that look great, feel intuitive, and actually work well.

ðŸš€ Currently, Iâ€™m looking for opportunities as a junior web developer / front-end developer, or roles where I can combine my background in design with my technical skills.

ðŸ’¡ Open to feedback, collaboration, and any opportunities to keep learning and growing in the tech world. Letâ€™s connect!
