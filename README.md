## Hi, I'm Laia! 👾

🎨 I’m a <strong>graphic designer</strong> turned <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> based in Spain. After finishing my degree in Graphic Design, I completed an intensive Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, where I specialized in creating responsive, user-focused websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js and MySQL.

✨ My passion is at the intersection of design and technology: I love building websites that look great, feel intuitive, and actually work well.

🚀 Currently, I’m looking for opportunities as a junior web developer / front-end developer, or roles where I can combine my background in design with my technical skills.

💡 Open to feedback, collaboration, and any opportunities to keep learning and growing in the tech world. Let’s connect!
